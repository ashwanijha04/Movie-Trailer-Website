Then download using the following command:

version=2.7.13
cd ~/Downloads/
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/$version/Python-$version.tgz
Extract and go to the directory:

tar -xvf Python-$version.tgz
cd Python-$version
Now, install using the command you just tried, using checkinstall instead to make it easier to uninstall if needed:
